- Install deps and run **pytest**
- Build Docker image and run a **smoke test** (health check + sample API calls)
- Test all new endpoints (workout-chart, diet-chart, progress)

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_app.py -v
```

### **Docker Development**
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t aceest-fitness:dev .

# Run with volume mounting for development
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd):/app aceest-fitness:dev

# View logs
docker logs <container_id>
```

The UI provides:
- **Log Workouts Tab** - Add and view workout sessions by category

## Notes

- The original provided Tkinter script was translated into HTTP endpoints so the app can be tested and containerized easily.
- The in-memory workout store resets on each restart; persistence is out of scope for this assignment but can be added later.
- Added conftest.py to resolve the module not found error which was failing the GitHub Work Action.
- V1.2 introduces tabbed interface with workout and diet recommendations (3 tabs).
- V1.2.1 extends V1.2 by adding visual progress tracking (4 tabs with matplotlib charts).
- V1.2.2 focuses on UI/UX polish without adding new functionality.
- V1.2.3 implements a professional design system with consistent styling.
- V1.3 adds comprehensive health tracking and reporting capabilities.
- All Tkinter versions are preserved to demonstrate incremental feature development.
